The results of the long-only NVDA trading strategy highlight a robust performance characterized by a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 32.63%. This return is tempered by a volatility of about 36.21%, suggesting that while the strategy yields attractive returns, it does expose the investor to significant fluctuations in performance. The Sharpe ratio of 0.90 indicates that the returns are relatively well-compensated for the risk taken, although it approaches the lower threshold of what is generally considered acceptable. However, the maximum drawdown of -52.44% raises concerns, suggesting that during unfavorable market conditions, the strategy can lead to substantial losses.

Despite these promising metrics, the strategy is not without its limitations. First, the reliance on a single stock—NVIDIA—may concentrate risk and limit generalizability; external market shocks could disproportionately affect performance. Furthermore, the strategy's sensitivity to key parameters (such as the chosen EMA and ATR values) could impact its effectiveness under different market regimes. Lastly, transaction costs were considered, yet they do not account for slippage, which could further erode profit margins in a real-world trading environment. Consequently, while the findings support the utility of this technical trading approach, further research is warranted to explore design modifications and adaptability across diverse market scenarios.
